This plugin improves your Obsidian workflow by helping you generate notes using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. The plugin also has support for older language models as well.

## Contributing

I'm not very smart so community help would go a long way in making sure new ideas can be added to the plugin. To get started, clone the repo to the plugins folder in an Obsidian vault. You can find more about this on the main Obsidian developer's page. To install dependencies, run:

```zsh
npm install
```

That's basically it for now.
